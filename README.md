Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus - DIAB Ontology
========================================

### About DIAB

The Type2Diabetes (T2D) Ontology (DIAB) was developed as part of the [BioMedBridges](http://www.biomedbridges.eu/) WP7-Phenobridge that aims to bridge the gap between the phenotype information available from mouse model studies and from human clinical data in the field of obesity and diabetes, enabling a new level of interspecies analysis of disease datasets. DIAB ontologically reuses classes from the [Human Phenotype Ontology (HP)](http://human-phenotype-ontology.github.io/), and [Mammalian Phenotype Ontology (MP)](http://www.informatics.jax.org/searches/MP_form.shtml), and creates complimentary classes under DIAB namespace to appropriately represent the T2D disease-phenotype associations with [OBAN](https://github.com/EBISPOT/OBAN) association model.

### DIAB Construction

DIAB describes T2D in relations to its disease stages and phenotypes, retrieving the candidate class relations from published literature. Text mining in this process is accomplished by Europe PMC [*Whatizit* pipeline](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/webservices/whatizit/info.jsf), aided by a phenotype dictionary composed of terms from the [Human Phenotype Ontology (HP)](http://human-phenotype-ontology.github.io/), and [Mammalian Phenotype Ontology (MP)](http://www.informatics.jax.org/searches/MP_form.shtml).
